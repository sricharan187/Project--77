            Console is the text entry and display device for system administration messages, 
            particularly those from the BIOS or boot loader, the kernel, from the init system and
            from the system logger.To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd +
            Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows).As an alternative, you could right-click 
            on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console"
            tab in that window.

            You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console
            log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the
            console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and
            then click Console.
